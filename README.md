## Description
• Welcome to Guess Numbers!                                                                                                                                            
• This is a simple text-based game where you try to guess a number within a limited number of attempts.                                                                         
## How to Play
1- When you start the game, you will be asked to input the number of guesses you'd like to have. This will determine how many attempts you have to guess the correct number.                                                                                                                                                                
2- The game will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100.                                                                                                          
3- You will enter your guesses one by one. After each guess, the game will tell you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.                               
4- The game will track how many guesses it took for you to find the correct number.

## Objective
• The goal is to guess the correct number in as few attempts as possible!

## Features
• Choose how many guesses you want before starting.                                                                                                                    
• The game responds with hints ("Down" or "Up") after each guess.                                                                                                      
• The game shows how many attempts it took to guess the correct number.                                                                                                  
• At the end the game shows how many points you got out of 100.
